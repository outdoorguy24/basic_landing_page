# Getting Started with Static Sites

Static sites are making a comeback in web development, and for good reason. They're fast, secure, and easy to deploy. In this post, we'll explore how to build a simple static site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What is a Static Site?

A static site consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are served directly to the browser without being generated dynamically on the server. This makes them:

- **Fast**: No server-side processing means pages load quickly
- **Secure**: Fewer attack vectors compared to dynamic sites
- **Reliable**: Less that can go wrong with simple files
- **Cost-effective**: Can be hosted for free or very cheaply

## Basic Structure

A simple static site typically has this structure:

```
my-site/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── style.css
├── js/
│   └── main.js
└── images/
    └── logo.png
```

## Getting Started

To create your own static site:

1. Create an HTML file for each page
2. Add your CSS for styling
3. Use JavaScript for interactivity
4. Test locally by opening the HTML files in your browser

## Adding Markdown Support

For blog posts and content, markdown is a great choice because:

1. It's easy to write and read
2. It converts easily to HTML
3. It focuses on content rather than presentation

To add markdown support to your static site, you can use a library like marked.js to convert markdown to HTML on the client side.

## Conclusion

Static sites are perfect for blogs, portfolios, documentation, and many other types of websites. They're simple to create and maintain, and they provide a great user experience.
