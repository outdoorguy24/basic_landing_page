# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is a static website?
A static website consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are served directly to the browser without being generated dynamically on the server. They're fast, secure, and easy to deploy.

### Why use a static site instead of a CMS like WordPress?
Static sites are faster, more secure, and cheaper to host. They don't require databases or server-side processing, making them ideal for simple blogs, portfolios, or informational sites.

### Can I update my static site easily?
Yes! While you'll need to edit the HTML or markdown files directly, you can use tools like GitHub Pages or Netlify to automatically deploy your site when you push changes.

## Technical Questions

### How is markdown converted to HTML?
This site uses marked.js, a JavaScript library that converts markdown to HTML on the client side. When you visit a page, the browser fetches the markdown file and converts it to HTML.

### Can I add dynamic features to a static site?
Absolutely! You can use JavaScript to add interactivity, forms, and other dynamic elements. For more complex features, you can integrate with third-party services or APIs.

### How do I deploy a static site?
There are many options for hosting static sites, including:
- GitHub Pages (free)
- Netlify (free tier available)
- Vercel (free tier available)
- Amazon S3 (low cost)
- Any web hosting that supports HTML files
